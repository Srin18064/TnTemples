        <h3 class="head_1">History</h3>
        <p>This temple was built by Pallava Emperor Nandhivaram in 715 CE. 
          In Pallava era, The region where the temple present was a dense forest. Amidst the forest, there was a large ant hill/ ant colony. Cows usually graze in forest lands. A cow, used to come to the ant hill and shed its milk everyday on the ant hill. The owner of the cow was confused as the cow had no milk. Regarding the empty udder, he asked the cowherd. However, he was also not aware of it. To know the reason, he himself secretly followed the cow while it was on its way to grazing. 
          The cow, as usual shed its milk in the ant hill. Curious to know the reason behind cow's act, the owner with the help of cowherd excavated the region. He was shocked as he saw the Shivalinga inside it. He informed the Pallava King Nandhivarman about Shivalinga. Nandhivarman, great devotee of Lord Shiva, built a temple at the same place where the excavated Swayambu Linga became the chief deity.
          After the Pallava period chola's also contributed to this temple.
