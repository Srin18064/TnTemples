        <h3 class="head_1">History</h3>
        <p> Chettipunyam derived its name because of a community, "Chettiyars", who lived here and earned their living through weaving. Originally the presiding deity of this temple was Lord Sri Varadaraja Perumal along with Goddess Hemambhuja Nayagi. This temple is over 400 years old. It was in 1848 that the idols of Sri Hayagreevar and Sri Devanatha Swamy, which were worshipped in underground chambers at Sri Thiruvahindrapuram, one of the 108 holy places near Cuddalore, were brought by Sri Dewan Rangachar to this village to be safeguarded during alien invasion. Sri Vedanta Desikar had composed a sloka with 32 verses in praise of Lord Sri Hayagrevar, which is popularly known as Sri Hayagreva Stotram. It is believed that worshiping Lord Sri Hayagreva brings wisdom and knowledge to the seekers. </p>
