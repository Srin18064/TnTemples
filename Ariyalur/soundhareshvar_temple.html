         <h3>History</h3>

         <p>Sage Siladha Tiruvaiyaru resident, performed penance on Lord Shiva in
           search of the blessing of a child. A voice spoke to the sage telling
           him that his wish could be fulfilled if he led the Puthrakameshti Yajna
           and that he would have a box with a child while he tilling the land for
           the yagna. He was advised to raise the boy who had longevity of only
           16 years. Siladha found the box and upon opening it, he found a boy
           with 3 eyes, 4 shoulders and a crescent moon decorating the head.

           Struck with shock, he closed the box and opened it again and found
           a child in normal human form and named the boy Japesar. Japesar turned
           14 and had two years left to complete the designated lifespan. The sage
           was very sad. Knowing the agony of his father, Japesar began the penance
           by standing on one leg in the Ayana Theertha tank in Tiruvaiyaru.

           The creatures in the tank began to consume him slowly, but Japesar didn’t
           stop then also. Lord Shiva was pleased by his penance, healed him
           completely and granted him long life. Later, Japesar married Suyasambikai
           in Tirumazhapadi. Japesar continued his penance even after marriage and
           was rewarded with a post at the head of Shiva Ganas and further elevated
           as the first chief of security at the first gate of Kailash and was
           appointed Nandhi Deva.</p>
